During my second year of college I wanted to learn more about Java's basic graphics and GUI libraries. This was the result.

# Controls

Reset Game & Score = SPACEBAR

## Player 1 

Up = A
Down = Z

## Player 2

Up = P
Down = L

# Installation Notes

This is a small java program. So to run it you need java installed
and have set up the enviroment variable.

* Compile it on the command line [Command Line tutorial](http://www.instructables.com/id/Programing-with-Java-using-Command-Prompt/)
* Use and IDE like eclipse [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/)
* Use a simplier IDE like TextPad [TextPad](https://www.textpad.com/)
